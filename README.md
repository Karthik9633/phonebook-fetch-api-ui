# PhonebookPro – Assignment 09

A simple and interactive Phonebook web application developed as part of **Assignment 09 – JavaScript Module**.  
This project demonstrates the use of **Fetch API**, **asynchronous JavaScript**, and basic **CRUD operations** with a clean user interface.

---

## 📌 Assignment Objective

To build a phonebook application that allows users to:
- Add new contacts
- View all contacts
- Edit existing contacts inside the UI
- Delete contacts
- Search contacts by name or phone number  
- Handle data asynchronously using Fetch API

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Fetch API
- JSON (local data source)

## ✨ Features

- Fetch contact data from a JSON file
- Add new contacts with validation
- Edit contacts directly inside the webpage (no prompt)
- Delete contacts
- Prevent duplicate phone numbers
- Search contacts by name or number
- Display "No contacts found" message when search has no result
- Clean and responsive dark-themed UI

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Contacts are loaded asynchronously using Fetch API from a JSON file.
2. JavaScript dynamically creates and updates the contact cards.
3. Event listeners handle add, edit, delete, and search operations.
4. Validations ensure proper input and avoid duplicate entries.

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Download or clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
3. Make sure the `data/contacts.json` file is accessible

> No additional setup or server required.
